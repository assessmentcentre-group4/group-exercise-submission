# Project Title

CX Chatbot

## Problem

When people prepare for their trip, they need to search for the flight information. However, Millennials have a busy life so they might have no time to browse all websites with required information. What if CX can provide a chatbot in Telegram to answer any questions about his/her trip?

## Functionality

The bot can answer the following questions when the user asked:
* Flight related
  * Flight price
  * Time of flight
  * Transportation to airport
  * Purchasing air ticket
  * Determine / answer whether an item can be brought on board
* Destination related
  * Weather of destination
  * Trip planning

## Components
* Parsing / Understanding usersâ€™ input
* Telegram bot server
* Database for flight information
* OpenWeatherMap
(all are on a node.js server)
